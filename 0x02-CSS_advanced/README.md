    <summary><b>Let's get some images!</b></summary>
    <p>The description of the project contains some inspiration for the final look of the project but weâ€™ll have to download some images.</p>
    <p>Head to unsplash and download 10 high resolution images that look as close to the final product that youâ€™re going to make. You will be using these same high res images for a project on Responsive Design in the future. Remember to also include the 3 images (the 2 logos and the favicon) linked in the description of the project.</p>
    <p>The images should all be representative of category they belong to. Images in the work category should be closely related to work.</p>
